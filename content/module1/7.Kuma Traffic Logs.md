### Traffic Logs (Observability)

Configure logging backends for use in the Mesh. A logging backend serves as a destination for access logs. In the present version of Kuma, logging backends can be either a file or a TCP log collector, like Logstash. Letâ€™s use the file (stdout) in our demo.

We need to configure the Mesh object to include what we want logged

```bash 
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - 
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: Mesh
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  mtls:
    enabledBackend: ca-1
    backends:
    - name: ca-1
      type: builtin
  metrics:
    enabledBackend: prometheus-1
    backends:
    - name: prometheus-1
      type: prometheus
  logging:
    defaultBackend: stdout
    backends:
      - name: stdout
        type: file
        # Use `file` field to configure a file-based logging backend.
        conf:
          path: /dev/stdout
EOF

```

Create a TrafficLog policy to select a subset of traffic and forward its access logs into one of the logging backends configured for that Mesh (stdout in our case)

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - 
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: TrafficLog
mesh: default
metadata:
  namespace: kuma-demo
  name: everything
spec:
  sources:
  - match:
      kuma.io/service: '*'
  destinations:
  - match:
      kuma.io/service: '*'
  conf:
    backend: stdoud
EOF
```
