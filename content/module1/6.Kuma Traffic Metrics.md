### Traffic Metrics (Observability)

By default, Kuma seamlessly integrates with Prometheus and Grafana. Once enabled, each data plane proxy exposes its metrics in Prometheus format. Additionally, Kuma ensures that Prometheus can effortlessly discover every data plane proxy within the mesh.

`kumactl install observability | kubectl apply -f -`

Verify by running the following command

`kubectl get pods -n mesh-observability`

Kuma ensures consistent traffic metrics across all data plane proxies in the mesh. Users can enable and customize metrics at both the mesh and individual Dataplane levels.

To enable metrics, mesh objects need to be edited with a traffic metric policy

``` bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - 
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: Mesh
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  mtls:
    enabledBackend: ca-1
    backends:
    - name: ca-1
      type: builtin
  metrics:
    enabledBackend: prometheus-1
    backends:
    - name: prometheus-1
      type: prometheus
EOF

```

Allow all traffic between Grafana and the Prometheus Server, as well as from the Prometheus Server to Dataplane metrics and other Prometheus components.

```bash 
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - 
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: TrafficPermission
mesh: default
metadata:
  name: metrics-permissions
spec:
  sources:
    - match:

Port-forward grafana pod in ns mesh-observability and visualize metrics on grafana (admin, admin) at `http://localhost:3000`

`kubectl port-forward grafana-78d497dcf9-dt5dl -n mesh-observability 3000`
