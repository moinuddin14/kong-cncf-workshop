### mTLS

Traffic Permissions enable you to control service communication, enhancing mesh security. You can specify which source services are permitted to consume particular destination services, with the service field being mandatory in both sources and destinations. Kuma includes a default traffic permission called **__allow-all-default__**

**__mTLS__** can be enabled using the below command

``` yaml
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f - 
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: Mesh
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  mtls:
    enabledBackend: ca-1
    backends:
    - name: ca-1
      type: builtin
EOF
```

Implementing this will make no difference. Because of the default **__allow-all traffic__** permission. To test/verify this, let's delete the traffic permissions using the below command

`kubectl delete trafficpermission -n kuma-demo --all`

Can verify no access
