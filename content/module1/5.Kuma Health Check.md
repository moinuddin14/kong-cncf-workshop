### Health Check

The objective of Health Checks is to reduce the occurrence of failed requests caused by the temporary unavailability of a target endpoint. By implementing a Health Check policy, you instruct a data plane proxy to monitor the health statuses of target endpoints. The dataplane ensures it doesn't send requests to an endpoint marked as "unhealthy."

```bash
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: HealthCheck
metadata:
  name: frontend-to-backend
  namespace: kuma-demo
mesh: default
spec:
  sources:
  - match:
      kuma.io/service: frontend_kuma-demo_svc_8080
  destinations:
  - match:
      kuma.io/service: backend_kuma-demo_svc_3001
  conf:
    interval: 10s
    timeout: 2s
    unhealthyThreshold: 3
    healthyThreshold: 1
